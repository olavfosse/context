Dear library maintainers, please do not include these or equivalent
transducers in your library quite yet. I'm putting a lot of thought
and effort into getting the API just right, which would be a waste if
subpar or inconsistent APIs are what the libraries end up
exposing. Your feedback however, is much appreciated. Thanks!

This is a work in progress library. I'm trying to get the API *just*
right as well as wack out any bugs. Until release aka v1 these fns
might change without warning, so it's best to copy-paste them into
your ns :^). Please try them out and give me any feedback!
